My goal is to build an AI system that:
Understands your goals, habits, lifestyle
Helps you make better life decisions
Plans your day and long-term goals
Tracks health, finance, behavior, and performance
Adjusts to real-time world events
Works across web, mobile, and wearable devices
Learns and evolves over time

🌱 Current Stage (Beginner Phase)
I am currently learning:
Core Java
DSA
OOP
Git & GitHub
Basic project structure

Right now, this repo will contain:
Simple Java programs
Project experiments
Early prototypes
Notes and designs

🛠️ Planned Tech Stack (Will Grow Over Time)
Beginner phase: Java, CLI programs, file storage
Intermediate phase: Java + Spring Boot, Web UI, APIs
Advanced phase: Python AI models, mobile apps, cloud, voice interaction

🧩 Roadmap
Phase 1 — Learning & Simple Features: CLI assistant, notes, reminders, goal tracker
Phase 2 — Web & App Integration: UI, login, dashboard, habit tracking
Phase 3 — AI Intelligence: NLP, recommendations, decision engine
Phase 4 — Multi-Device Assistant: Android app, iOS app, smartwatch, voice

📌 Why This Project Exists
To improve my coding skills, build discipline, and create something meaningful and long-term. Even though I am a beginner today, this project will grow with me.

✨ Final Note
This project is the beginning of a long journey. It may take years, but I will improve it step-by-step.
